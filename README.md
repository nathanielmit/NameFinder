# NameFinder
Used for finding potential names when given only some letters are known.

I got most of the trie code from Shubhadeep Roychowdhury here: https://towardsdatascience.com/implementing-a-trie-data-structure-in-python-in-less-than-100-lines-of-code-a877ea23c1a1 (primarily because he did it very simply and concisely)

I got the idea for this because I enjoy working on family history and geneology. I frequently work on transferring old scanned documents to electronic copies. While doing this, it is common to not recognize letters in names because of the way it's written. This tool can be used to create a database of names, then search the database with the letters missing that you don't know. It will return all possible names from the database.
